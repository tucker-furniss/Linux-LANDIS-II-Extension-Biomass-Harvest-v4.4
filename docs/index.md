# What is the Biomass Harvest Extension?

The Biomass Harvest Extension for LANDIS-II is derived from the Base Harvest extension and therefore shares many of the same features as Base Harvest. The largest difference is that Biomass Harvest supports partial thinning of cohorts.  Consult the user guide for Base Harvest for the most complete information.
